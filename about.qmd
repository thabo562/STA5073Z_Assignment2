Welcome to our website, where we, Thabo Dube, Kelly-Robyn Singh, and Natalie Alexander proudly present our project for our Data Science for Industry course (STA5073Z) 2023. Our primary goal was to perform a descriptive analysis on the content of the State of the Nation Address (SONA) delivered by the President of South Africa between the years 1994 to 2022. In order to achieve this goal, we performed sentiment analysis, and topic modelling to uncover the underlying themes and emotions in these speeches.
